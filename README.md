## Overview of the project
The purpose of the project is to create a web app by using BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape Mars data, and store the scraped data on a MongoDB database, then display the data by altering the design of the web app.

3. After adding Bootstrap 3 components, the web app has been made mobile-responsive. Also, by styling the webpage, the "Scrape New Data" button has been changed to 'success' green color,
